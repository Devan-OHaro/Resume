I am excited to apply for the Equipment Specialist position with the United States Coast Guard.
My extensive experience in propulsion machinery systems, combined with my commitment to meticulous technical analysis and problem-solving, aligns strongly with the mission and responsibilities outlined in this role.

In my role as a Nuclear Test Engineer, I have overseen the testing and maintenance of advanced propulsion systems aboard Virginia-class submarines, including the USS Texas, USS Virginia, and USS California.
These responsibilities required the application of detailed technical knowledge, rigorous problem-solving, and coordination across interdisciplinary teams.
I successfully navigated complex procurement challenges and provided detailed technical documentation to ensure operational readiness and compliance.

Additionally, I have hands-on experience preparing technical statements of work, managing recurring procurement issues, and recommending data-driven solutions for propulsion machinery systems.
My ability to assess technical trends, prepare justifications for acquisition strategies, and collaborate with engineering teams has consistently contributed to achieving organizational goals.

I am adept at oral and written communication, having delivered detailed technical briefings to diverse audiences and facilitated cross-functional collaboration to resolve issues effectively.
My academic background in Marine Engineering Systems from the United States Merchant Marine Academy further supports my technical expertise in propulsion machinery design, maintenance, and repair.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skills to support the Coast Guardâ€™s mission of ensuring the safety and reliability of propulsion systems.
I am particularly drawn to the chance to provide technical guidance, resolve procurement challenges, and contribute to the development of resilient systems for mission-critical operations.

Thank you for considering my application.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills align with the needs of this position.
I am eager to bring my expertise to the United States Coast Guard and contribute to the success of your operations.
