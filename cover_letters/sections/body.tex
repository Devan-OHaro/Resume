I am excited to apply for the Systems Engineering Manager position at Northrop Grumman. 
With a background in testing and evaluating complex mechanical, electrical, and nuclear systems aboard U.S. Navy submarines, I am eager to bring my experience to your team.

In my current role as a Nuclear Test Engineer, I have worked extensively on S6G and S9G reactor systems for Los Angeles and Virginia-class submarines.
My experience includes overseeing testing and troubleshooting of propulsion and auxiliary systems during maintenance and overhaul periods, ensuring operational readiness and compliance with technical specifications.
This hands-on experience aligns closely with Northrop Grumman’s focus on systems integration, rigorous testing, and technical leadership.

Beyond my direct engineering expertise, I have led efforts to improve technical documentation and testing procedures to streamline maintenance operations.
By collaborating with engineering teams, shipyard personnel, and naval leadership, I have helped optimize processes that enhance efficiency while maintaining first-time quality.
My experience managing these cross-functional teams has strengthened my ability to lead technical professionals and ensure mission success.

I am particularly interested in this role because of Northrop Grumman’s commitment to delivering innovative defense solutions.
The opportunity to lead and develop a geographically diverse engineering team while supporting the Longbow and B1 product lines aligns with my experience and career aspirations.

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background in submarine systems testing and engineering leadership can contribute to Northrop Grumman’s mission.
