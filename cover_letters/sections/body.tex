I am excited to apply for the Engineering position supporting surface ships and submarines within the Department of the Navy.
As a seasoned Nuclear Test Engineer with experience managing technical documentation, engineering processes, and project oversight for S6G and S9G reactor systems on Los Angeles and Virginia-class submarines, I am eager to bring my expertise to this role.

In my current position, I am responsible for the review, development, and approval of engineering studies, test procedures, technical manuals, and design changes.
I routinely work with interdisciplinary teams to resolve engineering challenges and ensure compliance with stringent specifications and operational requirements.
This aligns closely with the role’s focus on evaluating technical documentation, providing consultative services, and resolving complex engineering issues.

My experience includes leading collaborative efforts between contractors, ship’s force personnel, and engineering teams to monitor progress, establish priorities, and address production challenges.
I have cultivated a strong understanding of the importance of effective resource allocation and clear communication to maintain timelines and ensure successful project execution.

I also take pride in staying informed of the latest advancements in mechanical and marine engineering to propose innovative solutions and improve operational efficiency.
This proactive approach has enabled me to assess contractor activities, recommend improvements, and contribute to the development of highly efficient systems.

I am confident my technical background, combined with my ability to coordinate engineering efforts and deliver high-quality results, makes me well-suited to support the Navy's mission in this capacity.

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the needs of this position and the critical mission of ensuring the readiness and reliability of surface ships and submarines.
