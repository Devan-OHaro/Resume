I am excited to apply for the Naval Architect position listed on USAJobs. With a robust background in engineering, extensive hands-on experience with complex maritime systems, and a strong commitment to advancing resilience in coastal and naval systems, I am eager to contribute to your mission.

In my current role as a Nuclear Test Engineer, I have successfully managed testing and maintenance operations for advanced systems on Virginia-class submarines, including the USS Texas, USS Virginia, and USS California. I have extensive experience coordinating multidisciplinary teams, interpreting technical manuals, and ensuring rigorous operational standards. These responsibilities have honed my problem-solving skills and prepared me to excel in a dynamic, high-pressure environment.

My academic foundation in Marine Engineering Systems from the United States Merchant Marine Academy complements my practical expertise. During my studies, I conducted independent research on convection-diffusion equations to model cellular movement in fluid environments, showcasing my ability to tackle complex mathematical challenges. Moreover, my years of tutoring STEM subjects such as calculus, physics, and engineering concepts have enhanced my ability to communicate intricate ideas effectivelyâ€”a vital skill for collaboration and stakeholder engagement.

The opportunity to apply advanced hydrodynamic simulations, computational fluid dynamics, and structural engineering practices to enhance resilience against coastal and maritime hazards aligns perfectly with my skills and passions. My strong commitment to first-time quality, coupled with my ability to quickly adapt to new challenges, makes me confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and expertise align with the goals of your organization. I look forward to contributing to your mission of advancing maritime resilience and innovation.
