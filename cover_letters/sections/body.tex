I am excited to apply for the Mechanical Engineer position with the U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) in Baltimore, MD.
As a Maryland resident, I am familiar with the area and eager to contribute my expertise to the important mission of the SFLC.

In my current role as a Nuclear Test Engineer, I have developed extensive experience managing complex engineering projects and overseeing technical evaluations.
I have been deeply involved in the development, review, and refinement of technical documentation and operational procedures for S6G and S9G reactor systems aboard Virginia and Los Angeles class submarines.
This work has required not only technical precision but also collaboration with interdisciplinary teams to ensure successful project outcomes.

My experience also includes conducting independent studies to improve operational efficiency and implementing process improvements for the development of technical manuals and maintenance procedures.
I have worked closely with engineering and production teams to resolve issues, allocate resources effectively, and ensure compliance with rigorous technical standards.
This aligns closely with the responsibilities of coordinating engineering progress, conducting reviews, and recommending improvements for auxiliary machinery systems.

In addition to my hands-on engineering expertise, I stay informed of the latest advancements in mechanical engineering and related fields.
I value collaboration with subject matter experts to ensure solutions are innovative and effective, and I am confident my experience will allow me to thrive as a technical specialist within your team.

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the goals of the SFLC and the critical mission of supporting the U.S. Coast Guard.
